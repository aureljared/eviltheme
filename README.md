Eviltheme (**E**nhanced **Vil**lainROM **Theme** Engine) is an Android system modification platform meant for use with custom Android recoveries.
It allows modification of application resources without the need to replace the whole app or install a new operating system.

Eviltheme is based on the VRTheme Engine from 2011, though versions 3.x.x and up heavily differ from the original VillainROM code.

## Features

- Automatic systemless mode (Magisk v13.1+, Android 6+ required)
- System mode fallback in case Magisk is not present
- Supports both Dalvik and ART platforms
- Smart bytecode refresh (delete classes.dex/classes.art only if it is replaced by the theme)
- Easy uninstallation via automatically generated flashable ZIP
- Delete files (even inside APKs)
